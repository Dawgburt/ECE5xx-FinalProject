"""
Nick Allmeyer
ECE 554 x 558 Final Project

Description:
This MicroPython Code runs on a Huzzah32 board from adafruit.
It has an ESP32 chip which includes I2C connectivity as well
as WiFi capabilities.

This code is a heavily modified version of my weather station. It will first be tested over
the regular TCP Port and once that works, that code will be included in a comment and I will switch over to a
TLS TCP Port for testing the final application.

The board uses WiFi to connect to a public MQTT broker and sends the weather data to an android
app for display. The andoriod app can also remotely toggle the red led.

(invaluable for getting thonny and the huzzah 32 up and running)
